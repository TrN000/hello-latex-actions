    Sample document stolen from somewhere.

    \textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
    \LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
    I can also give equations their own space:
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
    \end{equation}
    If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.
    Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).

    For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
